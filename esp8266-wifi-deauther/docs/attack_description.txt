# Deauthentication Attack Overview

## 🔍 Description

The deauthentication attack abuses a vulnerability in the 802.11 WiFi protocol where management frames (like deauthentication packets) are **unencrypted**.

An attacker can spoof these packets to forcibly disconnect devices from their network — resulting in:
- Denial of service
- Interruption of access to the internet
- User confusion or redirection

## 🧪 Research Objective

This firmware is used to:
- Demonstrate wireless network vulnerability
- Simulate real-world WiFi-based denial-of-service attacks
- Study wireless client behavior in unprotected environments

## 🧠 Educational Goal

Understanding low-level packet-based vulnerabilities helps design **more secure wireless systems**, including protections like:
- 802.11w (Protected Management Frames)
- WPA3

## ⚠️ Note

This attack is **passive in discovery** but **active and disruptive in execution**. Only use in test environments or with clear authorization.
