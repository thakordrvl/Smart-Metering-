# Evil Twin Attack Overview

## 🔍 Description

The **Evil Twin** attack is a wireless spoofing attack where an attacker sets up a **rogue access point** (AP) that mimics a legitimate one. Victims may connect to it thinking it’s real, exposing their traffic or credentials.

## ⚙️ Attack Process

1. The ESP8266 scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks.
2. The user selects a target SSID via the web interface.
3. The firmware clones the SSID and starts broadcasting.
4. Victims may auto-connect to the rogue AP.
5. Optionally, the ESP can host a fake login portal (not included here).

## 🧪 Research Goal

- Demonstrate vulnerabilities in public Wi-Fi environments.
- Show how devices prioritize known SSIDs without validation.
- Study user behavior in presence of duplicate SSIDs.

## ⚠️ Legal Note

This attack is highly intrusive and **must only be used in a controlled lab environment** or with **explicit permission**.

Unauthorized deployment can be considered a criminal offense.
